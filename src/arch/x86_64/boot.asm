bits 32 ;We are still in protected mode
start:
	; The bootloader has loaded us into 32-bit protected mode on a x86
	; machine. Interrupts are disabled. Paging is disabled. The processor
	; state is as defined in the multiboot standard. The kernel has full
	; control of the CPU. The kernel can only make use of hardware features
	; and any code it provides as part of itself. There's no printf
	; function, unless the kernel provides its own <stdio.h> header and a
	; printf implementation. There are no security restrictions, no
	; safeguards, no debugging mechanisms, only what the kernel provides
	; itself. It has absolute and complete power over the machine.

	; To set up a stack, we set the esp register to point to the top of our
	; stack (as it grows downwards on x86 systems). This is necessarily done
	; in assembly as languages such as Rust cannot function without a stack.
	mov esp, stack_top

	call check_long_mode

	;Print 'OK' to the screen
	mov dword [0xb8000], 0x2f4b2f4f

	; If the system has nothing more to do, put the computer into an
	; infinite loop. To do that:
	; 1) Disable interrupts with cli (clear interrupt enable in eflags).
	;    They are already disabled by the bootloader, so this is not needed.
	;    Mind that you might later enable interrupts and return from
	;    kernel_main (which is sort of nonsensical to do).
	; 2) Wait for the next interrupt to arrive with hlt (halt instruction).
	;    Since they are disabled, this will lock up the computer.
	; 3) Jump to the hlt instruction if it ever wakes up due to a
	;    non-maskable interrupt occurring or due to system management mode.

; The multiboot standard does not define the value of the stack pointer register
; (esp) and it is up to the kernel to provide a stack. This allocates room for a
; small stack by creating a symbol at the bottom of it, then allocating 64
; bytes for it, and finally creating a symbol at the top. The stack grows
; downwards on x86. The stack is in its own section so it can be marked nobits,
; which means the kernel file is smaller because it does not contain an
; uninitialized stack. The stack on x86 must be 16-byte aligned according to the
; System V ABI standard and de-facto extensions. The compiler will assume the
; stack is properly aligned and failure to align the stack will result in
; undefined behavior.
